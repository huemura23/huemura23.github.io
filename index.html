    <h2>Tonga Tsunami</h2>
    <p>
      On 20 December 2021, a submarine volcano in the Tongan archipelago in the southern Pacific Ocean named Hunga Tongaâ€“Hunga Ha'apai began its eruption.
      The eruption caused tsunamis in Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa, Vanuatu, and along the Pacific rim, including damaging tsunamis in New Zealand, Japan, the United States, the Russian Far East, Chile, and Peru. 
      At least three people were killed, some were injured, and some remain possibly missing in Tonga from tsunami waves up to 15 m (49 ft) high. Two people drowned in Peru when a 2 m (6 ft 7 in) wave struck the coast. 
      The event was probably the largest volcanic eruption in the 21st century, and the largest recorded since the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
      NASA determined that the eruption was "hundreds of times more powerful" than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
      The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery reported that 600 buildings including 300 homes were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami. 
      The damage was estimated at US $43.7 million.
