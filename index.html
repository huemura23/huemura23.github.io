    <h4>Tonga Tsunami</h4>
    <hr>
    <h5>
      On 20 December 2021, a submarine volcano in the Tongan archipelago in the southern Pacific Ocean named Hunga Tongaâ€“Hunga Ha'apai began its eruption. 
      The unprecedented event, now considered the world's largest underwater volcanic eruption in three decades, severed the single cable that connects Tonga 
      to the outside world, effectively removing all internet and phone communication for the nation's 105,000 people. As a result, information on the true 
      extent of the damage and how the world could best help was significantly delayed. The event was probably the largest volcanic eruption in the 21st 
      century, and the largest recorded since the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery reported that 600 
      buildings including 300 homes were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami. The damage was estimated at US $43.7 million.
